# Unified Model: An energy harvester simulation framework.

**Disclaimer**: This is research code and, like most research code, is not considered production-ready. Expect things to break, explode and behave erratically. Here be dragons, you have been warned. Nonetheless, I've tried my best to keep things organized, well-documented and (somewhat) tested given a time-constrained research schedule. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions (or raise an issue).
