# FFS: A declarative energy harvester simulation framework.

**Disclaimer**: This is research code and, like most research code, is not
considered production-ready. Expect things to break, explode and behave
erratically. Here be dragons, you have been warned. Nonetheless, I've tried my
best to keep things organized, well-documented and (somewhat) tested given a
time-constrained research schedule. Please feel free to contact me if you have
any questions (or raise an issue).

If you're lost, this [Example
Notebook](https://github.com/mnicstruwig/unified_model/blob/master/experiments/2020-03-06-Example-Notebook.ipynb)
is a good place to start (even if it is usually slightly out-of-date).

TODO: Rest of the README.
