Steps
=====

Simulation
----------
1. Declare system
2. Run simulation of system
  - This should give us both mechanical position and EMF.

Comparison
----------
3. Read in ground truth mechanical data
4. Compare magnet position with predicted position.
5. Read in ground truth emf data
6. Compare adc readings with predicted emf.
